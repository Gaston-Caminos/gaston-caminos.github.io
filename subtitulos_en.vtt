00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Surely among you there is someone interested in music,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
sound, acoustics...

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, my beginnings were somewhat similar;

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
since I was a kid, I was very interested in music

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and started exploring the sound of different instruments

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
such as the guitar.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But over time that interest began to grow

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and I became more interested in knowing what was hidden behind the sound,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
knowing how to control it.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It was that desire to know that led me to study <i>Sound Engineering</i>.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
My name is <b>GastÃ³n Caminos</b>

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and today I want to explain what my mission as a Sound Engineer is.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Throughout my career and academic training

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I had the opportunity to learn about the various branches of acoustics.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
For example: <i>architectural acoustics</i>,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
or acoustics applied in the <i>environmental</i> or <i>industrial</i> fields.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Each project I worked on

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
gave me the opportunity to combine my passion for design

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
with the technical knowledge I acquired

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to design spaces that were not only aesthetically pleasing,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
but spaces that improved quality of life

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
through sound.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
From sound measurements to vibration analysis,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
each of the projects I tackled allowed me to expand my knowledge

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and understand how sound affects our daily lives.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Therefore, my goal as a Sound Engineer is to use that knowledge

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to improve quality of life

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and the quality of our environment

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
by proposing innovative solutions.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
If any of you are interested in learning how <i>Sound Engineering</i> can make a difference,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I invite you to explore my web portfolio where you will find the works and projects I have worked on;

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
so we can get in touch

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and see how in some areas of your company or enterprise

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
<i>Sound Engineering</i> can be applied beneficially.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Thank you very much for taking this time.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Have a great day ğŸ‘‹ğŸ™‚.
